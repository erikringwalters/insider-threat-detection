    <p>In this capstone project, our team researched
      how artificial intellicence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
      could best be applied to the problem of detecting insider threats with
      a general use system. Larger and more affluent corporations have been able
      to implement specialized ML models, but such technology is out of reach to
      small and mid-sized corporations, leaving them vulnerable.</p>

    Data was collected from Carnegie Melon's datasets on employees.
    The data included log on/log off times, number of emails sent and received,
    and whether they were labeled as an insider threat.

    We could explain how the anomaly(s) found in the plot above was interesting
    and may be useful for catching threats. Also how the one below doesn't seem as
    useful but at least we tried ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
